    "reasoning": "Given the application's focus on personal finance tracking and the requirement for offline persistence, the data structure prioritizes user-specific data isolation and simplicity. Transactions are stored within user-specific collections, enabling easy querying and management of individual financial data. To visually display a user's online/offline presence in real-time a dedicated `presence` collection is created, which stores connection state and a timestamp and is updated on connect/disconnect to Firestore.\n\n*   **Authorization Independence:**  Transactions are scoped under `/users/{userId}`. This eliminates the need for `get()` calls in security rules to validate user ownership because the path itself establishes ownership.\n*   **QAPs (List Operations):** Listing transactions is inherently secure because each user can only access their own transactions within the `/users/{userId}/transactions` collection. The segregation of transactions by user ID ensures that list operations only return data that the user is authorized to see."
